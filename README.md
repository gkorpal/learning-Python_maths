My Python 3 practice codes from the [mathematics explorations](https://gkorpal.github.io/posts/2021/01/higher-arithmetic-computations/#python-general-purpose-programming-language-open-source) I did during the academic year 2020-21 (equivalent to [CSC 110](https://gkorpal.github.io/files/csc110.pdf) and [CSC120](https://gkorpal.github.io/files/csc120.pdf) @ UArizona).

**Better option:** Ideally, one should have computer science background equivalent to this [Coursera specialization by Rice University](https://online.rice.edu/courses/computer-fundamentals/). However, I don't have that much time or patience. Therefore, I will rely on the [following resources](https://legacy.python.org/workshops/2002-02/papers/15/index.htm):

| Resource | Description |
| --------- | ----- |
| [Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python 3.5](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-computation-and-programming-using-python-second-edition) | This is the textbook for the edX MOOC series [Computational Thinking using Python](https://www.edx.org/xseries/mitx-computational-thinking-using-python) and [MIT OCW courses](https://github.com/guttag/Intro-to-Computation-and-Programming).|
| [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python 3.2](https://fbeedle.com/our-books/10-problem-solving-with-algorithms-and-data-structures-using-python-2nd-ed-9781590282571.html) | I came to know about this book from the MIT OCW [Introduction to Algorithms](http://ocw.mit.edu/6-006F11) which follows [the standard textbook](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition) with an added emphasis on using Python for solving exercises. This book is also [available online](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html), however you will need to use an adblocker or [host it yourself](https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/pythonds).|
